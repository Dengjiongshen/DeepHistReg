# DeepHistReg

The repository currently containts a simplified software used to obtain the results for paper entitled *Learning-based Affine Registration of Histological Images* accepted for the WBIR 2020 conference. The source code provided here is a minimal working example, without all the experiments and intermediate code which led to the proposed solution (like supervised/adversarial approaches/different cost functions/different network architectures).

The code will soon (probably May/June 2020) be replaced by the full DeepHistReg framework including deep segmentation, deep affine registration and deep nonrigid registration. The code will be much better documented and examples how to use it will be directly provided.
Meantime, you should consider the [unsupervised.py](https://github.com/lNefarin/DeepHistReg/blob/master/unsupervised.py) as the starting point.
